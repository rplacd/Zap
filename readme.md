# Zap 
is (or will be) a Z-machine (1-5) interpreter, hosted as a self-contained webpage, and written entirely in clientside JS. It attempts to do something with a little more flair than plain old console interface. Here I've retrofitted on a modified iChat-style theme: user input is echoed as chat bubbles, while Z-machine output is printed directly - divine intervention. Underneath the covers it should be predictable, though.

## Attribution and licensing
Zap itself is public domain, although credit where credit is due is nice. On my behalf - Zap uses:

* Bootstrap CSS by Twitter
* Underscore.js, truly scratches an itch for a recovering Schemer
* Mustache.js
* JQuery - duh.

These are bundled with the repo - *I'm not sure that's kosher, though, so I'll take them down if needed.*
